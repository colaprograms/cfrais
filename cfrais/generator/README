Run language to do all the stuff.

Credits:

language, generate_sentences.py, gram.py, regenerate_grammar.py are
written by me, Hannah Cairns.

alphabet.txt, generate_lm.py, generate_scorer_package are
part of Mozilla DeepSpeech.

The other binaries are built from Kenneth Heafield's code at
    https://github.com/kpu/kenlm
and they work on a Raspberry Pi 4 with raspbian buster.
